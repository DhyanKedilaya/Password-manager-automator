# Password-manager-automator

This is a simple password manager which uses the selenium module to automate the login process.

Make sure that the selenium works for the current version of google chrome browser in your system and also the chromewebdriver supports the version of google chrome in your system.
The same can be implemented in mozilla firefox but with the slight change that you'd have to use the geckodriver instead of chromewevdriver.
